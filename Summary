The Automatic Street Light System uses IoT devices like Arduino and sensors to enhance safety and save electricity. 
It eliminates manual control by automatically switching street lights on or off based on motion detection or ambient light levels.
During the day, lights remain off, and at night, they turn on when light levels drop or when a vehicle or pedestrian is detected.
This system improves road visibility, reduces energy waste, and helps prevent accidents. 
Its automation makes street lighting in smart cities more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.
